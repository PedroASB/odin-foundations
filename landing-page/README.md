## Description

HTML + CSS project (using flexbox).

It's a landing page for a fictional online programming courses platform called Kangaroo.

This was my second project using HTML and CSS, where the objective was to learn how to use flexbox in CSS. This tool has now become part of my front-end repertoire.

It was initially implemented as a template for a generic landing page, which can be found in `/landing-page/template-version/`.
